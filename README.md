# POT: Python Optimal Transport library
Python Optimal Transport library

This Python librarie is an open source implementation of several functions that allow to solve optimal transport problems in Python.

It provides the following solvers:
* Linear program (LP) OT solver/ Earth Movers Distance (using code from Antoine Rolet and Nicolas Bonneel).
* Entropic regularization OT solver (Sinkhorn Knopp ALgorithm)
* Bregman projection for Wasserstein barycenter and unmixing.
* Optimal transport for domain adaptation (with group lasso regularization)
* Conditional gradient and Generalized conditional gradient for regularized OT.

Some demonstrations of what can be done are available in the examples folder.
