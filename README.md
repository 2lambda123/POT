# POT
Python Optimal Transport library

This Python librarie is an open source implementation with several functions that allow to solve optimal transport problems in Python.

It provides the following solvers:
* Linear program (LP) OT solver/ Earth Movers Distance (using code from Antoine Rolet and Nicolas Bonneel)
* Entropic regularization OT solver
* Bregman projection for Wasserstein barycenter and unmixing
* Optimal transport for domain adaptation

Some demonstrations of what can be done are available in the examples folder.
